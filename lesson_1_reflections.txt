What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

pros
it increases the records in the history so difficult to find a particular change.

cons
sudden failure everything is lost

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
if the files are related to each other the it is good to save them together so in such case saving multiple files 
is a good option.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log gives the history of all the git commits.
git diff gives the  lines added and deleted in the code 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
If such changes happen i can go to the previous version using checkout


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
